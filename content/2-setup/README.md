## Setup 

### [Expo] Getting started with Expo

The fastest way to get started with React Native is to us Expo and run the app on your device. Feel free to use the React Native docs or Expo docs for reference.

#### You'll need:
- A computer (Mac, Windows or Linux).
- A smartphone (iPhone or Android).

#### Install Node

First, make sure you have Node.js installed (12 or later). You can do this by opening a terminal and running ```node -v```. If not you can install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). There's usually two versions to choose from, pick the one that says LTS (Long Term Support) after the version number.

#### Install Expo
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

This installs the expo cli globally. We'll be using this to create our new project.

#### Create the project

```
expo init AwesomeProject
```

You'll be prompted to choose a template. Pick 'blank' - we're starting from scratch!

#### Run the project

```
cd AwesomeProject
npm start
```

Note that you can also use ```expo start``` or ```yarn start``` if you have yarn installed.

#### Preview the app on your phone

First, make sure that your phone is connected to the same WiFi network as your computer. This is really important!

Next you'll need to install the Expo client on your phone. This is the native shell Expo provides that lets you get started without having the build the native app yourself. Go to the App Store or Play store, search for "Expo" and install it. You will also have to create an Expo account if you don't already have one (don't worry - it's free!).

Finally, open the browser window that was opened when you ran the packages. See the QA code? If you're on Android, you can scan the code with your Expo app. On iOS, open the camera app to can the code. You will be prompted to "open in Expo".

At this point you should see something like this:

And that's it! You're ready to start coding!

#### Folder Structure

Let's have a look at what the plain Expo application template looks like:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20091777/135953841-59015155-6a08-49df-8153-11468a24d306.png)

This is that my project structure looks like. Yours should look very similar. Let's see what's going on one by one:

- ```/.expo-shared``` - this is an expo internal folder, no need to peek in there
- ```/assets``` - this is where we store any assets we may want to use in our application, like images, videos, fonts and icons
- ```/node_modules``` - these are all the packages we have installed that make up Expo and React Native. Whenever you npm install a new package, it gets added here. This folder should never be checked into source control
- ```.gitignore``` - this is a file to tell .git which files and directories we want to omit from course control. node_modules is listed there
- ```App.js``` - the main entry point to our application. This is where you'll start adding code!
- ```app.json``` - another config file, mostly for expo metadata
- ```babel.config.js``` - babel config, used to add the expo preset
- ```package.json``` - this is where you list dependencies and add scripts
- ```yarn.lock``` - you might not have this, but I had yarn installed, so expo added all my dependencies using yarn

All in all, the only files you will really focus on are the ```App.js``` and ```package.json```

### [RN] Getting started with plain React Native 

If you are already familiar with mobile development (or if you can't or don't want to use Expo), you may want to use the React Native CLI. This requires Android Studio or XCode in order to get started. If you already have these installed, you should be up and running within minutes. If not, you should expect to spend an hour or so on installing and configuring them.

**Note!** If you are using a Windows or Linux machine, you won't be able to build the iOS app, but you can build the Android one. This is why a lot of React Native developers end up using MacBook Pros, since this way you can work on both native apps are the same time. If you want to test on your own iOS device but you don't have a Mac, you may want to look into using Expo instead.

For getting started, follow the React Native CLI quickstart in the [environment setup guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) until the section titled **"Creating a New Application"**. If you are on a Mac, you may want to choose iOS for this workshop, as the setup tends to be easier than Android on a Mac. Once you're done, let's pick up from "Creating a New Application" together.

#### Creating a New Application

Now that we've got all the environment prep out of the way, let's get started and create our application. Open your terminal and run:

```
npx react-native init AwesomeProject
```

Here, ```npx``` is a command line utility that's bundled with npm (installed with Node.js) and allows you to run command line programs from npm without globally installing them. ```react-native init AwesomeProject``` tells the cli tool to create a new project called AwesomeProject. You can use a different name if you prefer.

Now it's time to run the project! For native projects, we need to do two things:

1. Start the packager that inserts our JavaScript code into our app.
2. Build the native app.

First, lets start the packager:

```
cd AwesomeProject
npm run start
```

You can omit this step if you want, since the run command does also open a new window with and starts packager automatically, but I always do it explicitly, since I like knowing that the packager is up to.

```
npx react-native run-ios
```

This usually takes a little while to build, but once done it'll open your default simulator.

#### iOS - specifying a simulator

The ```run-ios``` command will always launch the app on your default simulator. However you might want to test your app on a different simulator. To do this, you can use the ```--simulator``` command line argument. For example to run run the app on your iPhone XR simulator, you can do the following:

```
npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone XR"
```

#### iOS - running on a device

First, connect your phone to your MacBook. If you've never done this before, you should get a prompt from iTunes permission dialog:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20091777/135955899-0b94c621-82db-4a7d-8a14-b151473672de.png)

After you click "continue", you should get an alert on your phone asking you to confirm. If you missed the alert or pressed "no" by accident, just unplug and plug in your phone again to be re-prompted.

Now you'll need to find you your phone's name. To do this, open your terminal (with the phone plugged in) and do:

```
instruments -s devices
```

This will list all the devices (real and simulated) available on your computer. I never changes my phone's name, so it's set at the default: "Kadiâ€™s iPhone" (notice the fancy ```â€™``` - this is important).

Now open the terminal in your project root directory (inside AwesomeProject) and run

```
npx react-native run-ios --device="Kadiâ€™s iPhone"
```

Where "Kadiâ€™s iPhone" is the name of your phone. Note that this will take a little while to build, and you have to make sure your device is unlocked while the installation is taking place.

#### Android - running on an emulator

First, we need to open an emulator. iOS simulator gets opened automatically, but for Android you'll have to do it yourself. Open Android Studio, click on the "Configure" option and choose "AVD Manager". AVD stands for "Android Virtual Device" and this is the menu where you can install, delete, edit and run emulators from.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20091777/135956002-65b967a0-a627-4108-ac09-2ad3ce95b68b.png)

Here you can create a new virtual device if you don't have on yet. Once you have a device, double click on it to launch.

Now that the emulator is running, open a new terminal window, navigate back to AwesomeProject and run:

```
npx react-native run-android
```

That's it! You're now up and running on your android device.

#### Android - running on a device

In order to run your app on your device:
1. Close the Android emulator (if you had it open)
2. Plug in your phone via USB
3. Enable USB debugging*

* To enable USB debugging on your device, you will first need to enable the "Developer options" menu by going to Settings â†’ About phone and then tapping the Build number row at the bottom seven times. You can then go back to Settings â†’ Developer options to enable "USB debugging".

For any platform-specific issues and nuances, consult the [documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device).

#### Emulator vs Simulator

You may have noticed we've been saying "iPhone Simulator" and "Android Emulator". This is intentional. The difference between emulators and simulators is that emulators mimic the software and hardware environments found on actual devices. Simulators, on the other hand, only mimic the software environment; they otherwise have access to all of the host system's hardware resources such as disk space, memory and processor speed. This means that on Android Emulators, you can be reasonably confident that the physical device will act similarly to the emulator. iPhone simulators however are free from hardware constraints such as running out of memory. This is why it's important to test your iPhone app on a real device if at all possible before publishing to the store.

#### Folder Structure

Your folder structure looks a little something like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20091777/135956266-87a5706b-2f2a-4464-87e0-50b4e95fd4c7.png)

If you also looked at the [Expo setup guide](https://github.com/adasilvapdev/React-Native-v2-FrontEnd-Masters-Course-Notes/blob/main/content/setup/README.md#expo-getting-started-with-expo) you'll notice that there's a lot more going on in this template. Here are the highlights:

- ```index.js``` - this is the main entry point of your application. It is equivalent to React on the web mounting the project to the root DOM node
- ```App.js``` - this is the file that we care the most about. This is where we'll be writing all our code
- ```/android``` and ```/ios``` - these are the folders where all the native code lives. If we needed to add or edit any platform specific native code, this is where we'd have to look. We also need to go into these folders if we have to install any native libraries
- ```.buckconfig``` and ```.flowconfig``` - the facebook react native template comes with flow pre-installed. Using this is optional though and we will be sticking with plain React Native in this workshop.
- ```.prettierrc.js``` this is a code formatter which is again optional, but you can read more about it in our [code style chapter](https://github.com/adasilvapdev/React-Native-v2-FrontEnd-Masters-Course-Notes/tree/main/content/setup#adding-a-linter)

### Adding a linter

This step is optional. If you want to just get stuck in the code, feel free to skip this.

Adding a linter to your React Native project is not mandatory, but highly encouraged. Not only does it help ensure a consistent code style throughout the project, it also highlights errors and often uncovers bad practices. I always set up linting and code formatting from the onset when starting a new project, even if it's just personal or a hobby project!

The go-to linter for JavaScript is called [eslint](https://eslint.org). There are three main reasons you should always install a linter:


1. Enforce consistent code style - double quotes or single? Trailing comma or no? Most experienced engineers have a preference one way or another, but ultimately most agree that it doesn't really matter, so long as it's consistent. With eslint we can set up these preferences once, and the whole project will be checked to ensure the same style is followed.

2. Catch mistakes - it's easy to miss typos, unused variables and forgetting to return a variable from a function while developing. When integrating eslint to your code editor, you'll get helpful warnings and errors for these issues while you're writing your code. Saves a lot of debugging time!

3. Avoid bad practices - JavaScript is a pretty amazing language in that it allows you to do pretty much anything. This is very powerful, but dangerous, because it leaves it up to us, the developers, to have some rules and order. Depending on the code style you do with (e.g. functional vs object oriented) there are many linting rules that help you enforce good practices that go with the code style you prefer.

#### Adding eslint - installation (step 1 of 4)

First, we should install the package. For this, open your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your project and run the following:

With npm:

```
npm install eslint @react-native-community/eslint-config --save-dev
```

With yarn:

```
yarn add eslint @react-native-community/eslint-config --dev
```

This will add two packages to your dev dependencies:

- eslint - the code linter for JavaScript
- @react-native-community/eslint-config - a community-built eslint configuration for React Native

You can always configure your own linting rules of course, but I like to start with community presets.

#### Adding eslint - adding the configuration files (step 2 of 4)

We've now installed both eslint and the community preset, but the eslint package doesn't know about the preset. In order to make eslint aware of this, we need to add a configuration file.

Create a new file in the root directory of your project and call it ```.eslintrc.js``` (yes, the filename starts with a ```.```). If you used ```react-native init``` to create your project, then you'll already have this file, but with Expo you'll have to create it.

Open the file and add the following:

```
// .eslintrc.js

module.exports = {
  root: true,
  extends: '@react-native-community',
};
```

This lets the linter know about the configuration package we want to use.

The community package actually comes with prettier pre-installed. Prettier is another package complimentary to eslint, but it focuses on code formatting. It mostly deals how the code looks rather than its correctness. The great thing about prettier is that if you can turn on "format on save" or have a pre-commit hook that runs its before a commit so your code will always be formatted uniformly.

Prettier has very few configuration options, because their mentality is to have as few variations as possible. I am definitely guilty of having a preference here. If you'd like your code to look exactly like mine in the example, add these prettier settings.

Create another file in the root directory of your project and call it ```.prettierrc.js``` (you'll already have this file as well if you used ```react-native init```)

Open the file and add the following:

```
// .prettierrc.js

module.exports = {
  bracketSpacing: true,
  singleQuote: true,
  trailingComma: 'all',
};
```

- ```bracketSpacing``` - adding a space around brackets, e.g. ```import { useState } from 'react';``` vs ```import {useState} from 'react';```
- ```singleQuote``` - using single quotes for strings, e.g. ```import React from 'react'``` vs ```import React from "react"```
- ```trailingComma``` - adding a trailing comma after array arguments (the default is not to have a trailing comma for the last element of the array).

#### Adding eslint - adding the run script (step 3 of 4)

Now we have eslint installed and configured. But how to actually run it? Open the ```package.json``` in your project and add the following under the ```scripts``` section:

```
"lint": "eslint ."
```

Now you can run ```npm run lint``` or ```yarn lint``` in your terminal and the linter will report both eslint and prettier issues.

#### Adding eslint - adding it to your code editor (step 4 of 4)

It's all well and good to lint your code on the command line, but ideally you'd have instant feedback while you're writing your code. Thankfully most code editors have an integration option for this.

#### VSCode
Code => Preferences => Extentions => ESLint

#### Atom

Atom => Preferences => Install => linter-eslint

You may have to close and reopen your code editor for the package to start working, but that's it! You now have the optimal working environment.

### Debugging

As developers, we spend a whole lot of time debugging, especially when learning something new. Let's look at some debugging tips for React Native.

Debug menu

- on device - shake the device (yes, really!)
- iOS simulator - Cmd + D
- Android emulator - Cmd + M on Mac, Crl + M on Windows/Linux

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20091777/135949426-caee1b62-80fc-434b-be1e-19ca56522cdc.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20091777/135949440-603556a2-f8c4-4041-972d-fb1508e9db66.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20091777/135949460-f3ad2ccd-3e42-428b-a656-5e80e6ba0d7f.png)

The debug menus for iOS, Android and Expo look a bit different per platform, but they all have the same options available.

The main options you'll use are:

- Refresh: this reloads the JavaScript bundle. You can also do this with Cmd + R (or Ctrl + R)
- Debug: this opens a debug window in your browser
- Show/hide inspector: this allows you to inspect individual elements on the page
- Enable/disable fast refresh: you might know this as "hot reloading", it will update your app with your changes when you save the file, no need to refresh manually

#### console.log() debugging

Sometimes it's just good to log stuff out to see what's going on. The good news is that ```console.log()``` works just the same on React Native as in plain JavaScript.

In order to log out to the console:

- Open the debug menu (as described above) and turn on debug - this will open a new browser window.
- Inspect the browser window (right click + inspect for most browsers).
- ```console.log()``` something in your app.
- The logged out text will appear in the browser console.

Note:

- ```console.warn``` will show a yellow box warning in React Native
- ```console.error``` will show a full screen error

Note: there is a known bug in [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30471) where typing in console incorrectly auto imports ```import console=require('console');```. You can get around this by turning off auto imports. Go to code => preferences => settings => auto imports to do this.
