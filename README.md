# React Native v2 FrontEnd Masters Course Notes

## React Native v2
Building mobile applications

## Welcome

Hi there, and welcome to React Native v2! 👋

## Course Objective

Kadi builds React Native apps for a living and her main goal today is to give you an idea on how I do it - what are the best practices, conventions, do's and dont's.

The aim of the course is to give you the knowledge and resources necessary to start building your own React Native project. We will cover what React Native is, how it works, what kind of components and tooling are available, and how to use them. We will stick with built-in and mainstream components, and minimize the use of third party components and libraries.

## Course guide

The course is designed to be pretty hands-on: the general pattern is that we'll introduce a concept and then apply it.

- Chapters marked with a 📝 emoji are exercises. How you approach them is up to you! If you generally learn best by doing, I'd recommend spending up to 10-15 minutes in completing the exercise independently before looking at the solution.
- Chapters marked with a 👀 emoji are the solutions to exercises.
- Make note of the link 🔗 emojis - these link to a GitHub repository that contains the solution to the code we just added - you can use this as a reference to check your work.
- There are three versions of the solution: [RN] for a plain React Native project, [Expo] for an expo project and [Live Coding] which is a exactly how the exercise was written live on the Workshop day. The resulting app looks the same, but there were some minor changes in variable names and order of operations which might be confusing, so if you're following the course on Frontend Master, you might want to use the version of the solutions with the 👩‍💻 emoji. Thank you Joumana for the writeup!
- You will also occasionally see links with a 🔍 emoji - these are code examples in Expo Snack, there to help introduce or illustrate a concept. You can look at these in the browser (unless specified otherwise) or on your phone if you have the Expo app installed. Feel free to play around with them, your changes will not be saved to the hosted version.
- You can follow this course with Expo or without, the choice is yours. For most lessons, this doesn't matter. There are a couple of pages that are specific to the platform though. These will be prefixed with [Expo] or [RN] - choose the one that applies to you, but feel free to also check out the other if you're interested.
