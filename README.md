Building mobile applications

# Welcome

Hi there, and welcome to React Native v2! ðŸ‘‹

# Course Objective

Kadi builds React Native apps for a living and her main goal today is to give you an idea on how I do it - what are the best practices, conventions, do's and dont's.

The aim of the course is to give you the knowledge and resources necessary to start building your own React Native project. We will cover what React Native is, how it works, what kind of components and tooling are available, and how to use them. We will stick with built-in and mainstream components, and minimize the use of third party components and libraries.
